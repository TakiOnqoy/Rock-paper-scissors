# Rock, paper and scissors

Welcome! This is a version of rock paper and scissors that I have developed in order to improve my coding skills.
I have used Python's native tools random and argparse.

It is meant to be played from the terminal:
Open the folder containing the download on your terminal and type:
'''
python3 rock_paper_scissors.py -h
'''
and you'll have all the options available to play it. 

It's quite silly, really.
